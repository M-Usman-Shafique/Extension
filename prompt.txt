I made a basic webpage bg color changer chrome extension using React.JS (vite):

At the first attempt, when I click the apply button after selecting a color from color picker, the bg color of webpage instantly changes. But when I select another color from the color picker & click the apply button, the bg color of webpage doesn't change instantly. Rather I have to reload the page to make the changes happen. Why is so? Why on the first time, the changes apply instantly without any need to reload the page. But on each subsequent attempt, why it needs a reload to apply the changes?
